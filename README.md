# How it works

We are using QR code because users can scanc it right aways without Barcode scancer.

Users need to login first since not every users have same authorization.

At main page users can add stock, sell stock, report, and retuen product. 

Add stock will lead to QR code scancer from webcam. Same process in Sell stock , Report, and Return Product 

QR code came from factory with all detall such as product name, price, quantity, and ect.
